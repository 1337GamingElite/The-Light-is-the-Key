# The-Light-is-the-Key
This is a simple 3D maze game that I made in Unity3D using C#

So far there is one level with two floors. The way you lose in this game is if you run out of battery in your flashlight, in which I still need to implement the game over feature. Around the map are teleporters in the shape of red boxes. The big question marks are teleporters the randomly teleport into one of how many random locations that I have put in. You can also collect coins in the game which can unlock some areas of the map depending on how much you have.
